This Python script sorts .JPG images in a selected folder into subfolders based on their image rating metadata (1â€“5), using ExifTool.

Only works with windows as of now.
This program uses [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) to get the image rating.


 Download and add ExifTool
- Go to: [https://exiftool.org/](https://exiftool.org/)
- Download the Windows executable zip: **`exiftool-xx.xx.zip`**
- Extract it.
- Rename `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`
- Move `exiftool.exe` and `exiftool_files`  into a new folder named `exiftool` into the folder

Run it through the gui file for now
